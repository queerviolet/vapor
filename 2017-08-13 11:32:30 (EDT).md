Man, I just need to journal a bit. I made a breakthrough!

I've been trying to pass individual coordinates to each particle
as a target. This is the beginning of all kinds of powerful effects, culminating (hopefully) in dynamic shader compilation.

At first, I couldn't create a float texture. So I turned on OES_texture_float,
though people on Stack Overflow say it doesn't work on mobile and I'll need to use this code:
	
	@[Code] glsl
   "vec4 pack_float(float f){",
    "   const vec4 bit_shift = vec4(256.0*256.0*256.0, 256.0*256.0, 256.0, 1.0);",
    "   const vec4 bit_mask = vec4(0.0, 1.0/256.0, 1.0/256.0, 1.0/256.0);",
    "   vec4 res = fract(f * bit_shift);",
    "   res -= res.xxyz * bit_mask;",
    "   return res;",
    "}",
and

    "float unpack_float(vec4 rgba){",
    "   const vec4 bit_shift = vec4(1.0/(256.0*256.0*256.0), 1.0/(256.0*256.0), 1.0/256.0, 1.0);",
    "   float res = dot(rgba, bit_shift);",
    "   return res;",
    "}",

I'm keeping the stupid string formatting because that's how the code came to me. Why would you post code like that? This poster was either too lazy to post it without the string literal noise, or decided they were doing us a favor, because obviously, the way to write code is inside the string literals of another language. Welcome to WebGL land.

Finally, it turned out that I needed to bind the texture. I had a vague sense that this was true; now, I suppose, it's a strong sense. It's things like this that make me appreciate my students.

Jesus, why haven't I been journaling more throughout this? I AM WRITING MY TALK.

When it finally worked, I gasped out loud.

Right now, all particles are reading from (0, 0), where we're writing (0, 0). Time to change that.
