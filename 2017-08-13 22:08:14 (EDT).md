I've been playing with particles all day. I got them attached to the page
by routing data through the DOM. It worked, but I didn't like the effect all
that much. The particles move better when you assign them in a strip, rather
than in groups.

I just refactored the particle system into a Component, and I'm so happy I
did it. I'm envisioning a simple but cool mechanism where you just have a pen, and components can grab the pen and draw something when they mount, streaming particles.
