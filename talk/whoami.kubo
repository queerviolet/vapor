@[Action] Who am I? (5 mins)
  - Ashi, teacher at Fullstack Academy
  - We teach React
  - Students are interested in doing new and crazy things
    - have little sense of what's possible
    - so, sometimes they want to do things that are not
    - but also, they are very amenable to encouragement to do new
      and interesting things
